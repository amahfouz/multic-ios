		<p>
			Multic, short for &quot;Multiplication Tic Tac Toe&quot;, is a logic game originally meant to teach kids multiplication and strategy, but it is also challenging for adults!</p>
		<p>
			<strong class="subtitle">Objective of the Game</strong></p>
		<p>
			Beat the computer and get four squares in a row in the 6x6 square grid.</p>
		<p>
			<strong class="subtitle">How to Play</strong></p>
		<p>
			You alternate turns with the computer. On your turn, you are allowed to move <strong>only</strong> one of the two number selection wheels. When you have made your move, the product of the two wheels is calculated, and the square with that number is filled in the grid. That square must be empty, or else your move is rejected and you are prompted to try again. The squares you fill are colored in <span style="background-color:#33cc99;">green</span> and those the computer fills are colored is <span><span><span style="background-color:#ff3300;">orange</span></span></span>.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong class="subtitle">Winning&nbsp;</strong></p>
		<p>
			The first to get four squares in a row wins. You can form a row horizontally, vertically, or diagnoally. If the board is full or there are no more valid moves to make, then the game is a tie.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong class="subtitle">New Game</strong></p>
		<p>
			Once a game has ended, you can start a new game by touching anywhere on the grid. The game starts with the number &quot;1&quot; selected on both wheels. You can also change the settings such that the initial number on both wheels at the start of the game is chosen at random, which adds more variation to the game. Settings are accessible from the action bar on top of your screen via the &quot;gear&quot; icon.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong class="subtitle">Levels</strong></p>
		<p>
			After you have beaten the &quot;Easy&quot;, and &quot;Medium&quot; levels, which are meant for kids, try the higher levels of difficulty, which are meant for adults. Let us know if you managed to beat the highest level of difficulty and remember to take a screenshot!</p>
